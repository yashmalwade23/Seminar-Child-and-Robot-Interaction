## Overview:
This seminar explores the topic of Child and Robot Interaction, focusing on enhancing the construction of a social bond between children and robots. Through a comprehensive study involving 174 participants, we investigate various aspects of this interaction, including perceived robot behavior, emotional responses, and preferences.

## Key Findings:
- **Comprehensive Study:** Conducted a thorough examination involving 174 participants to understand the dynamics of child-robot interaction.
- **Perceived Robot Behavior:** Analyzed participants' perceptions of robot behavior to gauge the effectiveness of social bonding.
- **Preferences:** Investigated participants' preferences in terms of robot design, behavior, and interaction styles.

## Results:
- **Statistical Significance:** Achieved statistical significance (p<0.05) in evaluating perceived robot behavior, emotional responses, and preferences.
- **Insights for Design:** Our findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of robots aimed at interacting with children, with implications for educational, therapeutic, and entertainment applications.
